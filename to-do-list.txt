1. `POST /login/ HTTP/1.1" 302`: This indicates a succesful login attempt.
The server responded with a status code `302`, which means a redirection
is required. The client should follow the redirection to the URL specified
in the response.

2. `GET /login/ HTTP/1.1" 200`: After the succesful login attempt, 
the client (typically a web browser) sent a `GET`request to `/login/`,
and the server responded with a status code `200`, indicating a succesful 
response. The client likely received the login page with the user authenticated.

# Solve CSRF token's request header (X-CSRFToken) error by ensuring 
# it's included in the request header, using Django's built-in CSRF 
# token template tag to generate the token in the JavaScript code
# and include it properly.
